I am Dmytro Rets, a Ukrainian citizen, working in “Fandom powered by Wikia” at Poland. I like to study new things, currently my attention is kept by Haskell. I can be spotted in [GitHub](https://github.com/drets), where you can find the [sources of this blog](https://github.com/drets/drets.github.io/tree/sources). If you are interested in my professional experience you can find me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drets).
