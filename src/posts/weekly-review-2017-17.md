My fifth weekly review is here. I am continuing to work on the third chapter of “How to prove it” book. I started to do a long distance walk.

Done on this week
---------

* “How to prove it“  
I didn't manage to finish the exercises in chapter three. However, I am not sad. Guess, why? Because I learned how to make the proofs, which is the main purpose of this chapter and the whole book, I think.  
I am at the end of the fifth section of the chapter. The chapter has seven sections. Sections six and seven have fewer exercises then three and four, so I feel that I'll finish the chapter on this week. Fingers crossed.

* I found a new interesting activity, which is also useful. I do a long distance walking (well, if seven km is a long distance) and listen to an audiobook. So, on this week I walked around 40 km and finished to listen “[О чём я говорю, когда говорю о беге](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/О_чём_я_говорю,_когда_говорю_о_беге)”. Pretty nice book. After listening to the book, I felt the desire to run a marathon distance, I wish to do it at some point in the future.  
Next book for my walking activity is written by the same author: “[Охота на овец](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Охота_на_овец)”.

* The interesting talk about the extended functor family:  
[George Wilson − The Extended Functor Family](https://youtu.be/JZPXzJ5tp9w)

* Handy one-liner bash, the command which joins the images. This is from [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) software.

    ```sh
    convert input1.png input2.png input3.png -append output.png
    ```

    `-append` join the images vertically  
    `+append` join the images horizontally  

* Some music which I listen during the week:
    1. [Acoustic Alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_Alchemy): all discography.
    2. [Tangerine Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine_Dream): Le Parc, Melrose, Rockoon, Tiger.
    3. The Rolling Stones: [Beggars Banquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beggars_Banquet).
