Trip to Warsaw. Started to work on chapter four.

<div></div><!--more-->

Last week
---------
I finished chapter three. The solutions of the exercises can be found here: [htp_3.pdf](https://github.com/drets/how-to-prove-it/blob/master/htp_3.pdf). I am on the second section of the “Relations” chapter.

After finishing the “How to prove it” book I want to work on the “[Verified Functional Programming in Agda](http://a.co/iJSr8IR)” book. Some knowledge of Agda may help me to become a better programmer.

My family had to travel to Warsaw for a few days. Here is one shot from there:

I tempted to think it's the main reason why I walked only 27 kilometers. Even if I walked only 27 kilometers it was enough time to finish listening to my second audiobook − “A Wild Sheep Chase”. I started to listen to another book that called “Hard to Be a God” by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. It's really cool that I do sports activity in conjunction with listening fiction books.

I listen to the really nice talk from “The Haskell Cast” series: [Episode 13 - John Wiegley on Categories and Compilers](http://www.haskellcast.com/episode/013-john-wiegley-on-categories-and-compilers).

I played with “[Programming with bananas and barbed wire. Part 1](https://monad.cat/posts/2016-05-10-barbed-wire.html)” tutorial; pretty cool introduction to recursion schemes.

This week
---------
I am going to walk 42 kilometers.

I am going to finish sections two _and_ three of the “Relations” chapter.
