This week
---------
I decided to spend a month or so on improving my math skills. I understand that "How to Prove It: A Structured Approach" book by Daniel J. Velleman is not a silver bullet and may give me only the basics. Hopefully, it'll help me to understand deeper the [Category Theory II](https://youtu.be/KaBz45nZEZw?list=PLbgaMIhjbmElia1eCEZNvsVscFef9m0dm) videos and prepare for [Software Foundations](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/) course which I have a plan to do at some point.

I'd like to do exercises from the book as many as possible, so here are my solutions for all exercises from the first chapter: [1.pdf](https://github.com/drets/how-to-prove-it/blob/master/htp_1.pdf).

Next week
---------

  - I plan to do exercises from the second chapter of the book.

  - If a friend of mine prepares the backend for “Highlighting” feature in Heutagogy project I may switch to the implementation of “Highlighting” on mobile.
