I am starting doing my weekly reviews. I am going to share the things which kept my attention, my opinion on these things and what I am going to do next. ~~Since these reviews are mostly for me I disabled “Comment on GitHub” button~~ _(friend of mine suggested to enable the comments)_. If you have questions or suggestions feel free to send me an email. ~~You may find my email on GitHub and link to my GitHub account is on “About” page~~ _(I added the email address to “About” page)_. Let's start.

This week
---------

  - **Microkernel**  
I went through series of articles on building simple OS kernel. I really suggest these articles to everyone who wants to get familiar with “bare metal” programming.  
Starting point: [Writing a Simple OS Kernel — Part 1](https://singpolyma.net/2012/01/writing-a-simple-os-kernel-part-1/)

  - **Annotations**  
I started to implement annotation for [Heutagogy](https://github.com/heutagogy) project, so a user can extract important pieces of information from the text and save it for reviewing later. One important thing to mention: I did few hours of *remote pair programming*, it was nice.

  - **Category Theory**  
I started to watch videos from [Category Theory II](https://youtu.be/3XTQSx1A3x8?list=PLbgaMIhjbmElia1eCEZNvsVscFef9m0dm). It's quite interesting but I decided to postpone watching these videos for a few month.

  - **Plotting**  
[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info) is a tool for plotting simple charts. I started to use it for plotting “Review pomodoros” chart.

  - **Lens**  
I worked through “Lens: a Swiss Army knife for data structures” article from not published _yet_ [Haskell](http://intermediatehaskell.com) book. Here's the article on the same topic from the same author: [Lens over tea](https://artyom.me/lens-over-tea-1).

  - **How to prove it**  
I decided to work on [“How to prove it”](https://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995) book. It should open the door for type theory and category theory books. Since I want to do exercises from the book I started to use [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) in emacs. TeX is cool and not scary at all, try it if you need to write math formulas.

  - **Secure shell**  
I connected to the laptop via phone and disabled/enabled keyboard/mouse just for fun. I used [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en) on mobile.

  - **Sticky keys**  
  I found a nice [xkbset](http://faculty.missouri.edu/~stephen/software/#xkbset) tool which helped me to enable mouse keys (pressing key emulates mouse click) permanently and sticky keys. However, I am still evaluating sticky feature since sometimes it's inconvenient to have all sticky keys, I'd like to restrict it only to the Shift keys, but it looks like it's not possible with this tool.

Next week
---------

  - finish implementing annotations for android app
  - start implementing annotations for chrome extension
  - continue working on “How to prove it” book
