It's my weekly review for the 15th week of the 2017 year. Since I work through the “How to Prove It: A Structured Approach” book. This week is all about it.

This week
---------
I finished to work through the “Quantificational Logic” chapter (chapter 2) and did the all exercises here: [2.pdf](https://github.com/drets/how-to-prove-it/blob/master/htp_2.pdf). It doesn't mean that I did the all exercises correctly, so feel free to create an issue and submit a pull request on GitHub for improving the solutions.

One year ago I was writing the tests using [SmallCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smallcheck-1.1.1/docs/Test-SmallCheck.html) and had a hard time understanding quantifiers. Finally, after finishing the chapter 2 I understood what does it mean universal ($\forall$) and existential ($\exists$) quantifiers and how to use them. Now, looking at the SmallCheck documentation doesn't scare me at all and even makes perfect sense!

Moreover, chapter 2 describes such things as the family of sets $\mathcal{F}$, the union of the family of sets $\cup \mathcal{F}$, the intersection of the family of sets $\cap \mathcal{F}$, the power set $\mathcal{P}(A)$ and much more.

Next week
---------

- I already started to work through “Proofs” (chapter 3) and even finished first 2 sections of the chapter. However, the chapter has 7 sections (the longest chapter so far and I think it's the core chapter of the book). So, I have ambitious plans to finish the chapter 3. I only 104 exercises away! Some of these exercises can be solved using the [Proof designer](https://app.cs.amherst.edu/~djvelleman/pd/pd.html). It's the small program which author of the book suggests for proving things.

- I need to do the exercise for my English classes and write the small essay about world overpopulation.
