    <title>Weekly Review 15</title>
    <link>https://drets.life/posts/weekly-review-2017-15.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s my weekly review for the 15th week of the 2017 year. Since I work through the “How to Prove It: A Structured Approach” book. This week is all about it.</p>
<div>

<h2 id="this-week">This week</h2>
<p>I finished to work through the “Quantificational Logic” chapter (chapter 2) and did the all exercises here: <a href="https://github.com/drets/how-to-prove-it/blob/master/htp_2.pdf">2.pdf</a>. It doesn’t mean that I did the all exercises correctly, so feel free to create an issue and submit a pull request on GitHub for improving the solutions.</p>
<p>One year ago I was writing the tests using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smallcheck-1.1.1/docs/Test-SmallCheck.html">SmallCheck</a> and had a hard time understanding quantifiers. Finally, after finishing the chapter 2 I understood what does it mean universal (<span class="math inline">∀</span>) and existential (<span class="math inline">∃</span>) quantifiers and how to use them. Now, looking at the SmallCheck documentation doesn’t scare me at all and even makes perfect sense!</p>
<p>Moreover, chapter 2 describes such things as the family of sets <span class="math inline">ℱ</span>, the union of the family of sets <span class="math inline">∪ℱ</span>, the intersection of the family of sets <span class="math inline">∩ℱ</span>, the power set <span class="math inline">𝒫(<em>A</em>)</span> and much more.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I already started to work through “Proofs” (chapter 3) and even finished first 2 sections of the chapter. However, the chapter has 7 sections (the longest chapter so far and I think it’s the core chapter of the book). So, I have ambitious plans to finish the chapter 3. I only 104 exercises away! Some of these exercises can be solved using the <a href="https://app.cs.amherst.edu/~djvelleman/pd/pd.html">Proof designer</a>. It’s the small program for proving things which author of the book suggests.</p></li>
<li><p>I need to do the exercise for my English classes and write the small essay about world overpopulation.</p></li>

<h2 id="this-week">This week</h2>
<p>I decided to spend a month or so on improving my math skills. I understand that “How to Prove It: A Structured Approach” book by Daniel J. Velleman is not a silver bullet and may give me only the basics. Hopefully, it’ll help me to understand deeper the <a href="https://youtu.be/KaBz45nZEZw?list=PLbgaMIhjbmElia1eCEZNvsVscFef9m0dm">Category Theory II</a> videos and prepare for <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/">Software Foundations</a> course which I have a plan to do at some point.</p>
<p>I’d like to do exercises from the book as many as possible, so here are my solutions for all exercises from the first chapter: <a href="https://github.com/drets/how-to-prove-it/blob/master/htp_1.pdf">1.pdf</a>.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I plan to do exercises from the second chapter of the book.</p></li>
<li><p>If a friend of mine prepares the backend for “Highlighting” feature in Heutagogy project I may switch to the implementation of “Highlighting” on mobile.</p></li>

    <title>Weekly Review 13</title>
    <link>https://drets.life/posts/weekly-review-2017-13.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I am starting doing my weekly reviews. I am going to share the things which kept my attention, my opinion on these things and what I am going to do next. Since these reviews are mostly for me I disabled “Comment on GitHub” button. If you have questions or suggestions feel free to send me an email. You may find my email on GitHub and link to my GitHub account is on “About” page. Let’s start.</p>
<div>

</div>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="this-week">This week</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microkernel</strong><br />
I went through series of articles on building simple OS kernel. I really suggest these articles to everyone who wants to get familiar with “bare metal” programming.<br />
Starting point: <a href="https://singpolyma.net/2012/01/writing-a-simple-os-kernel-part-1/">Writing a Simple OS Kernel — Part 1</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annotations</strong><br />
I started to implement annotation for <a href="https://github.com/heutagogy">Heutagogy</a> project, so a user can extract important pieces of information from the text and save it for reviewing later. One important thing to mention: I did few hours of <em>remote pair programming</em>, it was nice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Category Theory</strong><br />
I started to watch videos from <a href="https://youtu.be/3XTQSx1A3x8?list=PLbgaMIhjbmElia1eCEZNvsVscFef9m0dm">Category Theory II</a>. It’s quite interesting but I decided to postpone watching these videos for a few month.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plotting</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">Gnuplot</a> is a tool for plotting simple charts. I started to use it for plotting “Review pomodoros” chart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lens</strong><br />
I worked through “Lens: a Swiss Army knife for data structures” article from not published <em>yet</em> <a href="http://intermediatehaskell.com">Haskell</a> book. Here’s the article on the same topic from the same author: <a href="https://artyom.me/lens-over-tea-1">Lens over tea</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to prove it</strong><br />
I decided to work on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995">“How to prove it”</a> book. It should open the door for type theory and category theory books. Since I want to do exercises from the book I started to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</a> in emacs. TeX is cool and not scary at all, try it if you need to write math formulas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure shell</strong><br />
I connected to the laptop via phone and disabled/enabled keyboard/mouse just for fun. I used <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&amp;hl=en">Termux</a> on mobile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sticky keys</strong><br />
I found a nice <a href="http://faculty.missouri.edu/~stephen/software/#xkbset">xkbset</a> tool which helped me to enable mouse keys (pressing key emulates mouse click) permanently and sticky keys. However, I am still evaluating sticky feature since sometimes it’s inconvenient to have all sticky keys, I’d like to restrict it only to the Shift keys, but it looks like it’s not possible with this tool.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<ul>
<li>finish implementing annotations for android app</li>
<li>start implementing annotations for chrome extension</li>
<li>continue working on “How to prove it” book</li>
</ul>

    <title>Haskell eXchange 2016</title>
    <link>https://drets.life/posts/haskell-exchange-2016.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I was able to attend the “Haskell eXchange” conference in London. In this post, I’d like to introduce readers to functional programming and briefly highlight the advantages and techniques of functional programming which I learned from a talk<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> by <a href="https://donsbot.wordpress.com/about">Don Stewart</a>, the author of the book <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">“Real World Haskell”</a>. Then I’ll share some thoughts about how companies might start to integrate functional programming into their tech stack.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-functional-programming">Introduction to functional programming</h2>
<p><em>What is functional programming?</em><br />
A style of building programs using mathematical functions.</p>
<p><em>What is mathematical function?</em><br />
A relation exists between a set of inputs and a set of outputs; each with the property that each input is related to <em>exactly one</em> output.</p>
<p>Let me give an example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">var</span> x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span>

<span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">impure</span>(y) <span class="op">{</span>
  x <span class="op">=</span> x <span class="op">+</span> y<span class="op">;</span>
  <span class="cf">return</span> x<span class="op">;</span>
<span class="op">}</span>
  
<span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">pure</span>(x) <span class="op">{</span>
  <span class="cf">return</span> x <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span>
<span class="op">}</span>

<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">impure</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 4</span>
<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">impure</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 7</span>

<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">pure</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 4</span>
<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">pure</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 4</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Impure functions return different result for the same input (number <code>3</code>). In other words − impure functions have side-effects.</p>
<p><em>Why is this bad?</em><br />
Because you lose modularity and it is harder to think about functions with side-effects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s really easy to compose pure functions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">compose</span>(f<span class="op">,</span>g) <span class="op">{</span>
   <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="kw">function</span>(x) <span class="op">{</span>
     <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="at">f</span>(<span class="at">g</span>(x))<span class="op">;</span>
   <span class="op">}</span>
<span class="op">}</span>

<span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">plusOne</span>(x) <span class="op">{</span>
  <span class="cf">return</span> x <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span>
<span class="op">}</span>

<span class="kw">var</span> plusTwo <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">compose</span>(plusOne<span class="op">,</span> plusOne)<span class="op">;</span>
<span class="kw">var</span> plusThree <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">compose</span>(plusTwo<span class="op">,</span> plusOne)<span class="op">;</span>

<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">plusOne</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 2</span>
<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">plusTwo</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 3</span>
<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="at">plusThree</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>))<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// 4</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s like <em>lego</em> games; by having a set of pure functions you can easily build your own galaxy.</p>
<p><em>Why aren’t pure functions used all the time?</em><br />
Pure functions are awesome but the real life programs have a bunch of side-effects. Getting a response from the server, reading from the file, printing to the screen − all these operations have side-effects. You can’t build a truly <em>useful</em> program just on top of pure functions − you need functions with side-effects as well.</p>
<h2 id="don-stewarts-talk">Don Stewart’s talk</h2>
<p>Haskell has a smart way to distinguish between pure and impure functions. It is common in the Haskell community to write function types for the functions.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">makeApple ::</span> <span class="dt">Seed</span> <span class="ot">→</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> <span class="dt">Apple</span>
<span class="ot">makeJuice ::</span> <span class="dt">Apple</span> <span class="ot">→</span> <span class="dt">Juice</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you see <code>IO</code> (it’s a Monad) somewhere in type signature, it means the function is impure.<br />
As well, Haskell has strong static typing. Before running a program, compiler should correctly type check a program (and compiler can catch a dozens of errors!).<br />
Now, let me highlight some parts from Don Stewart’s talk. Don Stewart leads the Haskell teams in the financial sector. In his talk, he shared how to control complexity of applications with more than <strong>3</strong> million lines of code.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips from him:</p>
<p>• Types help to control complexity.</p>
<p>• Compare 2 pricing functions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">f ::</span> <span class="dt">Double</span> <span class="ot">→</span> <span class="dt">Double</span> <span class="ot">→</span> <span class="dt">String</span> <span class="ot">→</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>
<span class="ot">g ::</span> <span class="dt">Rate</span> <span class="dt">Libor</span> <span class="ot">→</span> <span class="dt">Spot</span> <span class="dt">SGD</span> <span class="ot">→</span> <span class="dt">Date</span> <span class="ot">→</span> <span class="dt">Rate</span> <span class="dt">SIBOR</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>g</code> has more expressive types. In other words, you can say more about the function by looking in function type assuming you know financial domain.</p>
<p>• Remove unclear types.</p>
<p>• No side effects. Instead, try to write pure functions as many as possible.</p>
<p>• Make things simpler by controlling <code>IO</code> and new types.</p>
<p>• Types are for keeping code maintainable and self-documented.</p>
<p>• Use “new types” and “data” to distinguish unique entities in the system.</p>
<p>• Using <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Phantom_type">Phantom types</a>, you can tag the things. Make it impossible to mix up or combine values in nonsense ways.</p>
<p>• As opposed to <code>Stings</code> and <code>Double</code> types have too many valid values for most use cases, <code>Bool</code> often has too little information.<br />
Instead of <code>authenticate :: String -&gt; String -&gt; Bool</code><br />
write <code>authenticate :: Privileges p =&gt; User -&gt; Password -&gt; IO (AuthUser p)</code></p>
<p>• Lift errors into types (using <code>Maybe</code> and <code>Either</code>) for  making functions modular.</p>
<p>• Move <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_functions">partial functions</a> to the edges and write total functions as a core of program.</p>
<p>• Types − in order to minimize complexity; it helps to deliver faster. Reuse is extremely cheap.</p>
<p>Of course, for the reader unfamiliar with Haskell, these tips don’t tell much, but let me repeat once more. Basically, the main idea is that you need to use meaningful types as much as possible. In such a way you give a compiler more information about a program and consequently, the compiler helps to catch a lot of errors and hopefully optimize the code. Other simple ideas are to use total functions, move side-effects to the edges of a program. That’s it!</p>
<h2 id="haskell-to-industry">Haskell to industry</h2>
<p>Even if Haskell has a great community with a lot of academic folks behind it, the community is really small compare to the Python or Javascript, or Php communities. It tends to lack some useful libraries, so if you switch to Haskell you should expect to have to contribute a lot to existing libraries or write more libraries for your needs. However, I believe it should be changed soon since a lot of people have realized that the OOP paradigm is not an answer to robust software development, especially in the time when parallel and concurrent programming plays more important role. I understand that re-writing back-end systems on Haskell, if you were building the systems during last 10 years using Javasript, Php, Java may not be an option. As a first step towards Haskell I suggest a “Haskell-like” language − <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>. Why Elm? Elm looks a bit simpler to start and it’s web-browser-based, and so it looks like a good alternative to almighty Javascipt. One more advantage of Elm is that you can introduce it gradually into an existing JS project<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Once you are happy with your front-end using Elm you may think to move some of your back-end services to Haskell. After Elm it should be much easier to start.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
